## Movie and user management system
Movie database web application with integrated registration and login features, account verification and password reset features using Java Spring framework, [React.JS.](https://reactjs.org/) and [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)

Main features:

* currently trending movies page
* search function
* profile page for the logged in users
* Watch Later list feature (users can check their own watch later lists from their profile)
* pages that give detailed information for every movie in the database, including trailers, cast, runtime, budget, etc, and additionally recommending similar movies, or other movies from the cast members. Also lists reviews for the movies: the users can write their own reviews, either verified or non-verified. To be able to write a verified review, the user has to answer a series of questions, and if the user is able to pass this questionnaire, they get a verified status from the given movie, which indicates that their review is reliable. The page shows 2 different review scores: the mean of the non-verified, and the verified review scores. The users can also check their own reviews from their profile page
